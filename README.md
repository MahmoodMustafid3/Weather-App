<p align="center">React Weather App is a web application that displays real-time weather information for a specified location. Users can search for a city or allow the app to access their current location to view details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). The app utilizes a weather API to fetch live data.</p>
